				<li><span class="">This Limited Warranty is valid only if the original proof of purchase for this Product issued by a <span class="keep-together">Sony</span> authorized dealer specifying the date of purchase and serial number**, is presented with the Product to be repaired or replaced. <span class="keep-together">Sony</span> reserves the right to refuse warranty service if this information has been removed or changed after the original purchase of the Product from the dealer.</span></li>
				<li><span class="">If <span class="keep-together">Sony</span> repairs or replaces the Product, the repair for the defect concerned, or the replaced Product shall be warranted for the remaining time of the original warranty period or for ninety (90) days from the date of repair, whichever is longer. Repair or replacement may involve the use of functionally equivalent reconditioned units. Replaced parts or components will become the property of <span class="keep-together">Sony</span>.</span></li>
				<li><span class="">
					<p>This warranty does not cover any failure of the Product due to normal tear and wear, or due to misuse, including but not limited to use in other than the normal and customary manner, in accordance with the <span class="keep-together">Sony</span> instructions for use and maintenance of the Product. Nor does this warranty cover any failure of the Product due to accident, software or hardware modification or adjustment, acts of God or damage resulting from liquid.</p>
					<p>A rechargeable battery can be charged and discharged more than a hundred times. However, it will eventually wear out – this is not a defect and corresponds to normal wear and tear. When the talk-time or standby time is noticeably shorter, it is time to replace your battery. <span class="keep-together">Sony</span> recommends that you use only batteries and chargers approved by <span class="keep-together">Sony</span>.</p>
					<p>Minor variations in display brightness and colour may occur between the devices. There may be tiny bright or dark dots on the display. These are called defective pixels and occur when individual dots have malfunctioned and can not be adjusted. Two defective pixels are deemed acceptable.</p>
					<p>Minor variations in camera image appearance may occur between devices. This is nothing uncommon and is not regarded as a defective camera module.</p>
				</span></li>
				<li><span class="">Since the cellular system on which the Product is to operate is provided by a carrier independent from <span class="keep-together">Sony</span>, <span class="keep-together">Sony</span> will not be responsible for the operation, availability, coverage, services or range of that system.</span></li>
				<li><span class=""> This warranty does not cover Product failures caused by installations, modifications, or repair or opening of the Product performed by a non-<span class="keep-together">Sony</span> authorised person.</span></li>
				<li><span class="">
					<p>The warranty does not cover Product failures which have been caused by use of accessories or other peripheral devices which are not <span class="keep-together">Sony</span> branded original accessories intended for use with the Product.</p>
				</span></li>
				<li><span class="">Tampering with any of the seals on the Product will void the warranty.</span></li>
				<li><span class="">THERE ARE NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, WHETHER WRITTEN OR ORAL, OTHER THAN THIS PRINTED LIMITED WARRANTY. ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ARE LIMITED TO THE DURATION OF THIS LIMITED WARRANTY. IN NO EVENT SHALL <span class="keep-together">SONY</span> OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOST PROFITS OR COMMERCIAL LOSS; TO THE FULL EXTENT THOSE DAMAGES CAN BE DISCLAIMED BY LAW.</span></li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p> Some countries/regions/states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, or limitation of the duration of implied warranties, so the preceding limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.</p>
		<p>The warranty provided does not affect the consumer’s statutory rights under applicable legislation in force, nor the consumer’s rights against the dealer arising from their sales / purchase contract. </p>
